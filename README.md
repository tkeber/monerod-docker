# monerod-docker

docker images with official monerod

find the resulting images for linux/amd64,(~~linux/arm64,~~)linux/armhf architectures on docker hub https://hub.docker.com/r/tkeber/monerod-docker

there is a QEMU bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1892684) that currently prevents building an arm64 image.
